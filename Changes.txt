CGI::Session::Serialize::yaml Change Log
========================================

4.22 - Tuesday, July 22, 2008
	* FIX:      Patch Build.PL and Makefile.PL to list all dependencies,
	  			and to specify a version of CGI::Session after this code was split out,
				so installing this module will trigger installation of a version of
				CGI::Session without it (this module). See RT#40056.
				Reported, with suggested patch, by Ryan Higgins
    * INTERNAL: Rename Changes to Changes.txt to match my other modules
    * INTERNAL: Add Changelog.ini

4.21 - Thursday, March 13, 2008

    * NEW: Create separate distro for this module by cutting it out of CGI::Session V 4.21.
           The requirement is for CGI::Session V 4.20 to be pre-installed so that you can
           install this module on top of CGI::Session without needing to upgrade to V 4.21.
           Of course there is no point in that, since V 4.20 already includes this module's
           code, but it allows you to reassure yourself that this distro does install ok
