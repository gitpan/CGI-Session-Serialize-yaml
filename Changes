CGI::Session::Serialize::yaml Change Log
========================================

4.21 - Thursday, March 13, 2008

    * NEW: Create separate distro for this module by cutting it out of CGI::Session V 4.21.
           The requirement is for CGI::Session V 4.20 to be pre-installed so that you can
           install this module on top of CGI::Session without needing to upgrade to V 4.21.
           Of course there is no point in that, since V 4.20 already includes this module's
           code, but it allows you to reassure yourself that this distro does install ok
