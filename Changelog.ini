Comments= <<EOT
* FIX: Patch Build.PL and Makefile.PL to list all dependencies
and to specify a version of CGI::Session after this code was split out
so installing this module will trigger installation of a version of
CGI::Session without it (this module). See RT#40056.
Reported with suggested patch by Ryan Higgins
* INTERNAL: Rename Changes to Changes.txt to match my other modules
* INTERNAL: Add Changelog.ini

[V 4.21]
Date=2008-03-13T00:00:00
Comments= <<EOT
* NEW: Create separate distro for this module by cutting it out of CGI::Session V 4.21.
The requirement is for CGI::Session V 4.20 to be pre-installed so that you can
install this module on top of CGI::Session without needing to upgrade to V 4.21.
Of course there is no point in that since V 4.20 already includes this module's
code but it allows you to reassure yourself that this distro does install ok
